## Problem 1

## Read and manipulate Data

``` r
Problem1_data =
  read_csv(file = './data/NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv') %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  select(line, station_name, station_latitude, station_longitude, route1: route11, 
         entry, vending, entrance_type, ada) %>%
  mutate(
    entry = recode(entry, "YES" = TRUE, "NO" = FALSE)
  )
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   .default = col_character(),
    ##   `Station Latitude` = col_double(),
    ##   `Station Longitude` = col_double(),
    ##   Route8 = col_integer(),
    ##   Route9 = col_integer(),
    ##   Route10 = col_integer(),
    ##   Route11 = col_integer(),
    ##   ADA = col_logical(),
    ##   `Free Crossover` = col_logical(),
    ##   `Entrance Latitude` = col_double(),
    ##   `Entrance Longitude` = col_double()
    ## )

    ## See spec(...) for full column specifications.

The Problem1\_data dataset contains 19 variables, they are line,
station\_name, station\_latitude, station\_ongitude, routes1:route11,
entry, vending, entrance type and ada. After reading the dataset, I
first clean the variable names using clean\_names function, then retain
the variables I need by select function, and convert the entry variable
from character to a logical variable by mutate and recode function. The
dimension of the resulting dataset is 1868, 19 (rows x columns). It is
not tidy since the route name and route number are messy.

## How many distinct stations are there?

``` r
Problem1_data %>% 
  distinct(line, station_name) %>% 
  nrow()
```

    ## [1] 465

There are 465 stations.

## How many stations are ADA compliant?

``` r
Problem1_data %>% 
  filter(ada == "TRUE") %>%
  distinct(line, station_name) %>% 
  nrow()
```

    ## [1] 84

84 stations are ADA
compliant.

## What proportion of station entrances / exits without vending allow entrance?

``` r
Problem1_data_novending_entrance =
  Problem1_data %>% 
  filter(vending == "NO" & entry == TRUE) %>%
  distinct(line, station_name)
Problem1_data_novending = 
  Problem1_data %>%
  filter(vending == "NO") %>%
  distinct(line, station_name) 
nrow(Problem1_data_novending_entrance)/nrow(Problem1_data_novending)
```

    ## [1] 0.4343434

43.43% of station entrances / exits without vending allow entrance.

## Reformat route variables.

``` r
Problem1_data %>%
  gather(key = route_number, value = route_name, route1:route11) %>%
  filter(route_name == "A") %>%
  distinct(line, station_name) %>%
  nrow()
```

    ## [1] 60

``` r
Problem1_data %>%
  gather(key = route_number, value = route_name, route1:route11) %>%
  filter(route_name == "A" & ada == TRUE) %>%
  distinct(line, station_name) %>%
  nrow()
```

    ## [1] 17

60 distinct stations serve the A train. Of the stations that serve the A
train, 17 stations are ADA compliant.

## Problem 2

## Read and clean the Mr. Trash Wheel sheet:

``` r
problem2_data_dumpster = 
  readxl::read_xlsx("./data/HealthyHarborWaterWheelTotals2017-9-26.xlsx", sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel", range = "A2:N258") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  filter(!is.na(dumpster)) %>%
  mutate(
    sports_balls = round(sports_balls),
    sports_balls = as.integer(sports_balls)
  )
```

## Read, clean and combine precipitation data for 2016 and 2017.

``` r
problem2_data_2016 = 
  readxl::read_xlsx("./data/HealthyHarborWaterWheelTotals2017-9-26.xlsx", sheet = 
                      "2016 Precipitation", range = "A2:B14") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  filter(!is.na(total)) %>%
  mutate(
    year = 2016
  )
```

``` r
problem2_data_2017 = 
  readxl::read_xlsx("./data/HealthyHarborWaterWheelTotals2017-9-26.xlsx", sheet = 
                      "2017 Precipitation", range = "A2:B14") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  filter(!is.na(total)) %>%
  mutate(
    year = 2017
  )
```

``` r
problem2_data_rbind = rbind(problem2_data_2016, problem2_data_2017) 
problem2_data_rbind$month = month.name[problem2_data_rbind$month]
```

## Explanation of the datasets

For problem2\_data\_dumpster, the number of observations is 215. The key
variables are dumpster, date, weight\_tons and volume\_cubic\_yards. By
the key variables, we can know the general information of the dumpster.
For problem2\_data\_rbind, the number of observations is 20. The three
variables, total, month and year are all key variables to know the
general information about the precipitation.

## What was the total precipitation in 2017?

For available data, the total precipitation in 2017 was 29.93.

## What was the median number of sports balls in a dumpster in 2016?

The median number of sports balls in a dumpster in 2016 is 26.
